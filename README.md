# PomoWalk

PomoWalk - work effectively, rest actively!

Become even more productive with active breaks every half an hour. Short walk improves blood circulation, clears the mind and lightens the mood!

PomoWalk is an application based on the Pomodoro technique, with alternating periods of concentrated work and rest, with one important addition: the application counts steps during rest and displays them in statistics. Just grab your iPhone when the break starts and take a little walk!

App features:

-customizable length of work and rest periods, with or without a long break - be flexible;

-the timer for the next interval turns on automatically - focus on what’s really important;

-the 1-minute before end signal won’t let you get lost in time;

-you can assign a task for each working interval;

-all completed intervals will be shown in the History tab, where you can delete the interval or reassign another task;

-track the number of steps and active breaks in the Achievements tab;

-4 interesting color schemes - choose one according to your taste and mood.

Important!
Step counting is not available on the iPad.
To count steps correctly, make sure that fitness tracking is enabled in the iPhone settings (Settings - Privacy - Motion & Fitness - Fitness Tracking).
